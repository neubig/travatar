This code takes in a hypergraph and a language model then outputs a sentence.  
It is split into a library (search/) and a standalone wrapper (alone/).  The
library is also in Moses (-search-algorithm 5) and cdec (--incremental_search
$lm).  

COMPILING
Requires Boost >= 1.41.  Tested on linux.  

Compile with 
./bjam

USAGE
After compiling, the decoder is bin/decode.  Run without an argument for help.

To run, you will need one language model, feature weights, and hypergraphs.  

The language model must be in ARPA or KenLM format.  Pass -l lm where lm is
the file name.  

Feaure weights can be specified in a file using -w or on the command line with
-W.  Weights are key=value pairs like cdec.  The hard-coded features are
LanguageModel, LanguageModel_OOV, and WordPenalty.  WordPenalty is word count
times -1/ln(10) for odd historical reasons dating back to Hiero.  The feature
definitions are compatible with Moses and cdec.  

Hypergraphs are stored in a directory with one file per sentence.  The files
are named starting with 0.  The first line of each file is

total_vertex_count total_edge_count

Then the file enumerates each vertex in bottom-up order (i.e. they can only
reference vertices that have already been defined).  A vertex is simply a list
of competing ways to derive it (downward edges).  The first line lists the
number of edges.  An edge looks like

foo [3] bar [7] [5] baz ||| Feature=5 AnotherFeature=10

where foo, bar, and baz are literal words and [n] references vertex n.   Edges
can have arbitrary arity (i.e. as many references as desired).  The tokens <s>
and </s> should appear explicitly; they are not added by the decoder.  

A complete example:

7 13
1
<s> ||| Quux=10
2
[0] le ||| Distance=1.5
[0] la ||| Distance=1.1
2
[1] petit ||| Distance=0.0
[1] peti ||| Distance=3.0 Foo=4
3
[2] chas ||| Distance=1.1
[2] char [1] ||| Distance=0.8
[2] chat ||| Distance=1.0
2
[3] est ||| Distance=2.0
[3] Est ||| Distance=0.0
2
[4] more ||| Distance=1.0
[4] mort ||| Distance=0.0
1
[5] </s> |||

This is the format produced by cdec's --show_target_graph option.  But if
you're using cdec, the code has already been natively ported and can be
accessed using --incremental_search lm.  

DIRECTORY LAYOUT
util and lm: copied from KenLM
search: core search algorithm and portable to other decoders.  
alone: a standalone wrapper around the search implementation.
